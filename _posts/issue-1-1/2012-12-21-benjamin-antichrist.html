The following document is no exception. Found in the archives of the Smithsonian Institution, it is an apocalyptic prophecy by one “Benjamin, the Anti Christ,” recorded in 1866 in the city of San Francisco. It lays out nothing less than a earthquake-based cataclysm that would literally change the shape of the United States. The West Coast would disappear, Mexico would be absorbed, and the Caribbean would become an American lake—again, a literal one. The cataclysm would then set the stage for a final battle between the U.S. and the Catholic countries of the world. It would also bring a New Jerusalem in Arizona and plagues of brain paralisis [<em>sic</em>].
