excerpt: >
  An excerpt from Jackie Sibblies Drury's play, <i>We are Proud to Present…</i>, in which a group of black and white American actors struggle to make a play about Germany's genocide of the Herero in late-nineteenth century Southwest Africa. They have only one source, a cache of letters home from German soldiers, and their own misconceptions: sometimes funny, sometimes hideous. It does not go well.

<a href="/issues/2013/4/interview-with-jackie-sibblies-drury-the-reenactors">Elsewhere in this issue of <i>The Appendix</i></a>, we interview the writer Jackie Sibblies Drury about her play <i>We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as South West Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1884-1915</i>, which earned <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/theatre/2012/04/16/120416crth_theatre_als">glowing</a> <a href="http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/theater/reviews/we-are-proud-to-present-a-presentation-at-soho-rep.html">reviews</a> during its recent runs in Chicago and New York. Its plot is this: six black and white American actors attempt to make their own play about the imperial German genocide of the Herero people of South West Africa in the late nineteenth, early twentieth century. After a rapid-fire, surprisingly slapstick overview of the history, the play’s main body follows the well-meaning but often egotistical actors as they chafe at the primary source that they hoped might inspire their work: a cache of letters sent home by German soldiers.

Sibblies Drury shared an excerpt of the play with <i>The Appendix</i>. In these two scenes, the actors attempt to adapt one of those letters—but then fight about it. The play barrels headlong to a fierce and upsetting conclusion, but in this excerpt, at least, tempers are not so frayed that the play isn’t still bitingly funny. A challenging balance of social criticism, racial violence, and inquiry into how deeply we can empathize with the dead, <i>We Are Proud to Present</i> is the breakout contribution of a new voice in American theater. We are grateful to Sibblies Drury for the chance to introduce it to <i>The Appendix</i>’s readers.

Dear Sarah.<br />
We awoke before dawn again this morning. And walked, and walked,<br />

I dream of walking in the heat.<br />
There is so much heat here Sarah.

I will hold your picture to my lips and feel refreshed.
